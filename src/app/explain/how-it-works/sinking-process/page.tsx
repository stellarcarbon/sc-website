        Customers can sink <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" /> tokens,
        meaning they buy the token and immediatly {`"lock it in"`}. This locking
        means the <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" /> is no longer a
        tradeable object and the investment into the project is now funded.

      <Paragraph>
        The locking mechanism is contained within each transaction.
        Stellarcarbon only offers transactions that immediately retires the{" "}
        <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" /> in exchange for CarbonSINK. As
        such, the customer will receive CarbonSINK in their wallet, not the{" "}
        <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" /> itself. The CarbonSINK asset
        represents an equal amount of <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" />{" "}
        sunk and has no inherent value.
