        Our customers can sink <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" /> tokens,
        meaning they buy the token and immediatly {`"lock it in"`}. This locking
        means the <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" /> is no longer a
        tradeable object and the investment into the project is now funded.

      <Paragraph>
        We {`don't`} like the term burn so we use sinking instead.

        The locking mechanism is contained within each transaction.
        Stellarcarbon only offers transactions that retire the purchased{" "}
        <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" /> in exchange for CarbonSINK. As
        such, the customer will receive CarbonSINK in their wallet (not the{" "}
        <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" /> itself) after the{" "}
        <SCLink href="/explain/how-it-works/retirement">retirement</SCLink> is
        completed. The CarbonSINK asset represents an equal amount of{" "}
        <CARBONCurrencyIcon className="inline" /> sunk and cannot be traded.
