  "1. The form already shows your balance, and the Pool amount might also be known already, so some errors maybe could be preventable by not letting you submit to begin with? \n\nBut there might be other errors in the signing process, it would be nice to maintain the state of the form in these situations.\n\n2. There are other drawback of cutting off any new typing after reaching the limit but that is what seems to feel more expected for maxlength type fields? I think in the current form the warning could be a bit clearer. Another thing is maybe the shape of the field (textarea) creates an expectation of long texts but 28 is not often more than one line I imagine? Also I tried to include many line breaks in my text but it seems these are filtered on the next step?",

  "-Put dapp link in nav\n-would it make more sense to set, then label? Kind of thinking of it like a memo\n-Should My Stellarcarbon be landing of dapp?\n- Add a way to go back to dapp from estimator",
  "-When not connected, the message shown is \"No wallet connected! To sink CARBON please connect a wallet.\" I would suggest switching from the negative to a more invitational tone like \"Let's connect your account first to...\". This helps differentiate from an unexpected situation or friction point to sound more like a soft step towards the goal.\n\n-When connecting, the state for \"selected\" for the wallet options didn't seem clear to me. I took me a couple of clicks to understand i was selecting that specific wallet. Even though it looks good visually, perhaps something that resembles more a radio button would have made it more explicit.\n \n- When clicking on the emission estimator and then going back i lost my customized label. If we could keep the state in between these inner navigations it would be nice\n\n- Currency selector looks nice as it already shows my balance! I would just add the currency logo to it.\n\n- Validation happens when clicking to sign so a red message like \"label too long\" will only go away when clicking again in the button, it doesnt dynamically validate while i edit the message( although the char count does, which is nice)",
  "I don’t think you need to do anything for the app itself. It’s great. One area to expand might be offering access to more projects or types of projects (eg, biodiversity credits) or credits from other providers. ",

  "It was really well done.  The only issue I had was a user issue in that my test wallet was not funded and the error wasn't specific about why I couldn't connect my wallet.  It said, \"None available\".  I figured it out, but at first thought maybe it was a connection issue and not a funding issue.",
  "-If the calculator is supposed to take a long time, give some estimate. If it should be quicker, maybe add a timeout and show an error if it takes too long\n-I'm not sure about xBull. Currently a red text shows: \"t.getAddress is not a function\"\nProbably make that more informative.\n-The \"NotFoundError: Not Found\" can also do with a more informative message",

  "Make it clear why I should use it. Also, I would like to have a manual with screenshots to easily navigate the app. For instance, the dashboard was the homepage, but this wasn't instantly clear. I think the whole concept is just a bit complex to understand in one sentence. What is \"sinking\" exactly?  "
