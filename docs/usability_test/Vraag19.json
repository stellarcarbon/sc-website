  "Very straightforward and no issues using it. Well done",
  "Smooth experience overall, results are also visible quite fast.",

  "This was my first experience using a dApp, and it was very positive.\nThe navigation was simple, actions were clear, and the transaction signing process was very intuitive.",
  "Other dapps are more consumer focused. The stellarcarbon site has some consumer aspects, but it also has things that are focused on other business/integration partners.\n\nActually, it feels more like a demo of what you can do with stellarcarbon.",
  "It seems full featured but worry individuals wont read the explain first. A how to example might help.",
  "It's working nicely and is snappy in general. I did not have any bugs too.",
  "This was smoother to use than most",
  "Web dapps are fine. But I think in time, you may want to create a mobile app.",
  "Seems like a simple and straightforward dapp. A bit rough on the edges but on the right path.",
  "Smoother! Stellar is just so much better to use than Ethereum / L2s and the app is smooth and intuitive from beginning to end. \n\nAs an app-developer myself I can say that your app is inspirational, especially its ease of use. Albedo is great as well! Making a wallet took like 30 seconds. ",

  "The user flow was smart and snappy. No delays and definitely didn't get stuck. The interface which its squared borders and colors reminds me of my e-boekhouden software and appears a bit 'boring', this doesn't have to be a bad thing of course. Besides feeling good myself about taking care of my personal emmissions, I can imagine that users feel the urge to tell their contacts that they've engaged in such chivalrous activity. I generated a certificate I believe, but I don't know where that went (maybe not really a thing on testnet). Lastly I think other dApps keep reminding me throughout their respective flows 'why' I'm doing whatever I'm doing. For example, you could feed me stats about how much trees, turtles and communities I'm saving with my efforts every step of the way.",
  "not applicable",
  "I like it a lot! I REALLY like that you have the transaction preview. some dapps don't make that kind of information as clear as it should be.",
