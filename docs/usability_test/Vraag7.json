  "Yes",
  "conversion and genral  enviromental benefits were big draws!",
  "Site is simple and easy to navigate so a great landing page for anyone who is interested in the project",
  "Transparency, both in the explanations of the workings but also in all the software shared.",
  "All important links were working properly and I liked the transparency about projects, software, and transactions parts.",
  "I liked the clean layout and how information is structured — it made it easy to understand a new concept like Stellarcarbon. The balance between technical content and visual simplicity is well achieved.",
  "The \"Projects\" page",
  "All of it was pretty positive.",
  "The Verra part. But I lacked a bit of context and links to understand what this really is.\n\nI also really liked the software page with all the link to everything. Though not sure if you want to have this that prominent for your target audience.",
  "Working with Verra, a description of where the carbon credits are coming from and being able to see the Blockchain explorer of carbon sinking demonstrate the project is a nice way to demonstrate legitimacy and quality. ",
  "It's a fairly clean basic design. But too much text, on some pages. The \"about us\", needs profile pictures of the team, and links to the parent company. I think( no sure),  there a typo \"Blockchainifier\" on the, about us page.  ",
  "I like the usage of green scenery in the background which goes well with the project. Perhaps the elements in front of it like the section for 'our mission' or 'for business' could have some very light transparency",
  "no way",
  "The ‘about us’ segment was great, very informative. ",
  "The transaction page was compelling as well as the dashboard.",

  "The project and Transaction pages were very nice and useful addition to the site.",
  "I liked the real time transactions explorer and the projects page. the verification links with the data were good indicators of the work being done with stellar carbon",
  "I like the color theme and the rainforest background",
  "The transaction explorer is slick, the homepage overal is calming and straightforward",
  "Yeah, the intent to save environment in such a way I felt was really good.",
  "The references to verifications, the verra registry and source-code. Gives more credibility.",
  "I think the projects page and the software give a positive impression of StellarCarbon. The Projects page verifies that there is currently project ongoing and that StellarCarbon is already more than just a promise, I also like the design and the openness. I think the phrasing and design of the software page is spot on for the target audience and also gives the impression that there is sophisticated software behind StellarCarbon.",
  "The transaction for the co2 was very fluid and easy",
  "Graphics, parallel scrolling and colors "
