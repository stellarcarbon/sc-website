  "Getting  to GItHub was relatively  challenges,  but  not  as hard as quickl accessing the on-chain data attesting to prokjects bruning and actually  removing  carbons",
  "Navigation was smooth and fluid, no issues on that front.",
  "Going to the calculator from the sink Carbon form clears your form, and when you come back to the form after the calculation the custom label is sort of skipped (autofilled and scrolled past.)",
  "X button at the bottom is not clickable. I couldn't log in with xBull.",
  "In dark mode, the favicon becomes hard to see.",
  "Id consider renaming software to Docs.\nAlthough they function as intended, some pages are text heavy.",
  "All good.",
  "I think the website is maybe too textual and my feeling would be to remove as much text as possible and replace it with images/videos. Also have more detail available if someone wants to click for it but the core explanation of how things would would ideally be visual and fit on on mobile screen. ",
  "No technical issue with the website, that I saw. I saw that it's mobile friendly. The site needs more rich media, like video, audio, pictures, and graphics. These mediums can be used to tell the story of the nature projects,  your company ( and founders), as well as carbon credits  market ( and blockchain advantages)",
  "No issues. Just noticed that on the Home, the for business section shows an HR line that feels out of place when scrolling with the background",
  "no",
  "No it looks great!",
  "Nope",
  "Nope",
  "The first link on the page takes me away from your site to the SDF site, that's not very immersive/engaging.\nThe counter for the amount of carbon stored/sunk takes way too long to count up to the final number. I suggest to start counting with 10 or 100k steps, then  take smaller increments as you reach the target, so it's done in ~5 seconds or so",
  "Not at well. The interactions were smooth and full of information.",
  "no issues. the about me has a lot of info which is good but it can be cut down. explain should be renamed to learn. ",
  "No",
  "No",
  "Yeah, actually I want to be able to connect to a wallet and start using the website. I tried connecting freighter, it connected as well. But then it was showing some Not Found Error, which is bad. The Wallet Connection UX can really be improved. You guys gotta read some good books on UX I guess.",
  "The page was stuck on loading, when I put an invalid transaction",
  "I appreciate you level of detail and transparency in the about-us section. Especially your whole journey through different SCF rounds shows compassion and your strong believe in the project. Still it might be too much for a single page. I'd suggest splitting it up a bit and maybe introduce some kind of blog-style section where those pieces of information could go.\n\nThe header-image for software is repeated in the background of transactions page.\nThe transactions- and the about-us-page don't have a header-image at all. That makes the overall impression a bit inconsistent.\n\nThe whole transactions-page with sub-page into details is not too intuitive or too techy.\n- Maybe pop-up or overlay instead of a sub-page for transaction details\n- Remove the selector for amount of transactions to show. It would be smoother if you'd just dynamically load more transactions as the user scrolls down the page.",
  "No",
  "No. The website layout and information architecture makes a lot of sense to me.",
  "Critical look at the phrasing :\n1. of the Mission: I think the phrasing of the Mission is fine, but might be improved.  I think the bio diversity project should appear earlier than the third row. Low hanging fruit: Stellarcarbons mission is to provide .. -> StellarCarbon provides .. (The section title is already our Mission). \n\nMinor technical issues: \n1. The carbon emission reduction counter under Mission in kg takes too long imo.\n2. It appears that the second page title \"Explain/ What is StellarCarbon\" is different on Iphone and on laptop.",
  "Too hard on the eyes.  It looks dark and uninviting. Difficult to read text. The colors and images are not very visually appealing - it doesn't look like a modern website.",
  "Logos in the 'early adopters' aren't visible due to dark logo on dark background.",
  "No issues",
