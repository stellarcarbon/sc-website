  "Not sure",
  "More on partners and projects\n",
  "maybe just add a FAQ section, that would include a simplified explanation of carbon credits",
  "A link to more info on Verra in general could be nice. I found one Verra link but that was for the specific project.\n\nThere is a little explanation about fractional sinks needing to be rounded up or down. The link at the end to read more is not a link. Also \"read more\" can be the link",
  "Information was helpful!",
  "I'd suggest offering a Spanish version of the website. It would help expand access for people interested in carbon projects from Latin America and Spanish-speaking regions.",
  "The amount of detail is confusing for me as a normal user. ",
  "Vera link hidden under projects, but is part of docs and explain.\nWould be great to see visual representation of how much Stellar Carbon is helping offset emissions like a graph of something under transactions.\nExamples or tutorials could be beneficial as this is really new to Stellar.\n",
  "I would have liked to have a more visual approach for the lifecycle of the token. That would help to understand how the offset is made and also why at some point the token cannot be sold anymore as sunk.\n\nOne big things people have in mind when browsing can be transportation as it's common now for airlines and rail companies to display that info and propose to buy back. I missed a bit of case study and motivation examples on how this project is different and help.\n\nFor the business side, I am not sure what I can do by reading at the info. Having some example or use case story like could help. I could see how I could use this into my project Tansu to have people offset their code. But I need some info about how to do that, what makes sense. Like some guidelines on how to estimate for folks the carbon to buy function of what they do. Something else?",
  "I think multiple, non-overlapping groups of people (carbon credit people, blockchain people, ordinary people who want to offset they carbon footprint) might use this site but it could be a struggle for them to understand content related to the other group. E.g. carbon credit people might need a very simple visual explainer about how the tokens are used what the explorer is showing. And Blockchain people might need more understanding about sinking carbon etc. And ordinary people could probably do with a really simple visual overview with most of the details hidden. ",
  "I reviewed all the content, but if the content was for a \"retail audience\", you may need to use more a story telling approach. Talking about the carbon credits, and blockchain technology will not win over the retail audience. You need to appeal to them on an emotional level first. Then allow them to go deep into the technicals of carbon credits & a blockchain api.",
  "I think the amount of information is appropriate for these pages although i feel the transaction layout has some room for improvement. The helper icon and information displayed is great but something about having to click on the 'back arrow' icon to close the helper info felt a bit off.",
  "no",
  "I would be interested in one or two sentences about the Ucayali project‚Äôs social impact/co-benefits for the local population.",
  "The team üòâ",
  "Nope",
  "A 1 or 2 sentence introduction that explains what *I* can do on the website.\nThere is a lot of background information on what you do, projects, partners etc, but after browsing the site, I'm still not sure what I'm going to do. \nAs far as I know, the idea is:\n1) I buy Carbon tokens for money. \n2) The money is used for CO2 offset projects. \n3) I receive a token or transaction ID as (public) record that I did this\n\nI'm also hoping to see the estimates for household emissions in the calculator soon. \n",
  "As a new user I quickly found my way to find content about stellarcarbon on the website. My only suggestion is to add a summarized version of \"About us\" on the landing page aligned with the vision and mission of StellarCarbon would be great for user experience.\nAlso a minor suggestion: consider embedding the ‚ÄúProgress Monitoring Report‚Äù PDF on the product page. Or a small label/tag beside the link as [PDF] would work, so whenever an user clicks on it to help users understand that it will open or download a PDF file.",
  "n/a",
  "Information about how to pay and/or why you need to use a blockchain wallet",
  "Would prefer informational graphs/images to replace some of the walls of text. I think all the text is written from a 'pitch' perspective where the reader is assumed to be a grant giver. Instead I'd look directly at the end user who is visiting the page and address them instead (consumer or builder): \"You can contribute to nature based projects.\" \"Stellarcarbons provides you with a convenient way to use XLM.\" \"Improve your own product by tapping into our API and making it easy for your users to contribute.\"",
  "No",
  "No",
  "No, was able to intuitively navigate through all the various pages. With the wallet disconnected, I didn't see any menu button for \"Dashboard,\" though I did get to it when I clicked \"Contribute now\" on the homepage.",
  "No",
  "visuals",
  "Some more visuals would have been nice - maybe around the process of using blockchain vs traditional methods.",
  "About Us is still a bit vague, there is a mention about Nature Nexus, a link or more explanations would be welcome. In the same way, no mention of the people behind the project.",
  "I am not a crypto user due to which the difference between wallets and the stellar system was a bit vague. For crpyto users that is probably not a problem.",
  "A simple diagram/flowchart how exactly stellar contributes to \"nature based projects\". Just a simple overview in an image what it is all about. What are nature-based projects really? Good to make clear, it's the carbon that's related to green house gasses. "
