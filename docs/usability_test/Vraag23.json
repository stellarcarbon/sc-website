  "Well done to all, and thanks for inviting me to help review test and give appropriate feedback.",
  "Good luck :)",
  "Thank you! Great work!",
  "This was my first time using a decentralized app, and I found Stellarcarbon very intuitive and welcoming. I would be happy to keep testing future features or improvements.",
  "looking forward to Stellar Carbon!",
  "Thanks for reaching out and give me the chance to try it out! Hope that helps and feel free to reach out anytime.",
  "I think the user experience was quite good, I just think maybe things might need to be hidden or explained more depending on the category of user. ",
  "I think it would dramatically enhance your project, if somehow you incorporated, data oracle connected to real world data sensor networks.  Like if the carbon credits are linked to pollution of some type in a region, have environmental sensors collecting data 24/7. I mean with IoT loraWan networks, that have low bandwidth sensors, to monitor air, water, soil ( etc..) quality. Taking daily measurements, is extremely low cost. depending on the type ( and quality) of data, you may be able to market it, to other industries.",
  "Keep up the good work! It is looking great!",
  "If any project available for school feeding program",
  "Thank you for your hard work, this is beautiful!!!",
  "thing this will mainly be interesting for b2b consumers will probably not directly do this that much. But integrations with other apps where you can optionally offset some carbon or businesses that want to integrate it in their apps seem interesting",
  "At some point, it would be good to get a web designer to simplify the look of  the website.  Easily done, but first impressions are important so when this goes live, it would likely add credibility to the entire project.",
  "Your website (and the dapp) gives a lot of information and details.\nPersonally, I like that, but I'm not sure if that's representative for a broader audience.\n\nAs an example, under the Pending Retirements Balance, there is this text:\n\"Your pending balance is a round number, so we can automatically contribute these CARBON to a personal certificate. This is a manual process and should not take more than a couple days. Check here for updates.\"\nThe last 6 words contain the information I need, the rest is 'additional'.\nThere's a contradiction between 'we can automatically' and 'manual process' and the \"round number\" thing doesn't matter in this situation.\n\"We can contribute your CARBON to a personal certificate. This is a manual process, check back in a few days\" may be a better message.\n\nIn contrast, the message when you have a fractional amount pending is great for me.\nIt states the 'problem':\n\"To create a personalized certificate we have to submit a whole number of CARBON () to the Verra registry.\"\nIt gives me options, then buttons to choose one.\nThe information presented is relevant to me at that time, to let me make a choice.",
  "I generally purchase offsets in the KLM flight interface, because they also award me with additional loyalty program XP. For this reason I would always pick them as my 'carbon offset' partner. In future, it may help stellarcarbon to offer additional incentives to users who pick Stellarcarbon as their offset partner. ",
  "Really well done! Coming along incredibly well!",
  "I might be wrong, but I find it hard to imagine that someone would just go to your website and buy carbon credits with XLM. Although, I could see it being part of some payment processors like a little textfield/button/UI element to \"tip\" a bit extra when paying for something. So, I would also suggest contacting all the remittance providers or w/e is out there right now that's taking in some payments on Stellar.",
  "not really! it looked good",
  "Keep it up! Just make it more simple and understandable. Good luck! "
