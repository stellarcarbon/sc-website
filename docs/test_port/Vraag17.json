  "little different than using the wallets kit https://github.com/Creit-Tech/Stellar-Wallets-Kit",
  "Had no issue navigating and using the options.",
  "1. Errors in signing (I had these: no USDC balance, not enough CARBON in the pool) reset your input in the form so you have to start over filling and writing your label\n\n2. The label field lets you write more characters than allowed, and the warning is sort of clear but a bit small. Only after trying to submit a bigger error message appears.\n",
  "The experience was very smooth. ",
  "I didn't experience any technical issues.\nHowever, one important improvement would be to offer a Spanish version of the dApp.\nThe interface is very intuitive, but language could become a barrier for many potential new users.",
  "An annoyance: It takes a lot clicks to connect your wallet.",
  "Getting to the dapp wasnt straight forward when not on home page. \nOrganization of the dapp was a bit confusing",
  "There is a lot of things to sign and not enough details on the previous screen to understand what are all these trustline changes when you do this for the first time. (Also I don't understand why there was still trustlines to do for the second transaction.)\n\nThe link here is not working: \n\"The amount of fractional carbon certificates that are still pending a certificate claim. What does this mean?\"\n\nPaid by/Recipient is not clear as it's the same address. I guess that changes if you transfer the token?",
  "I thought overall the experience was very smooth. The calculators for other categories would be good to have. I tried clicking on \"what does this mean\" for pending claims but nothing came up. ",
  "I know it was testnet. But the USDC( testnet) to XLM ( testnet) was way off",
  "Overall, it is great, I sense it can be polished around the experience and positioning of UI elements but these can be done as gradual improvements.",
  "None come to mind- using this tool is remarkably smooth and intuitive from back to front- I would be curious to learn how it could be adapted for corporate or governmental use. ",
  "the only paint point was when hitting back button when for example signing the tx all fields were empty (didnt even contain the placeholders)",
  "-The calculator either took very very long, or got stuck when I tried to estimate for a flight\n-Signing in with xBull on Firefox (desktop) did not work (but this may be an xBull problem, since the extension is outdated and can't be updated. But you may need to catch/handle the error with some information then)\n-Signing in with Xbull on Brave (desktop) gives a \"NotFoundError: Not Found\"\nThis is resolved by using an account that is funded on testnet\n-When starting to sink a fractional amount, a message appears \"If you sink a fractional amount of CARBON you cannot receive an indvidual certificate without either rounding down or up. Read more here.\" (typo in 'individual'), but the link doesn't lead anywhere.\n-If you select USDC as asset to pay, but don't have balance, an error appears that explains it.\nHowever, if you then click the 'Back' button underneath the error, the amount of CARBON is reset to 1. I expected it to keep the amount I put in.\n",
  "1. This might only be me, but I kept clicking on the wallet buttons waiting for a popup. I thought they'll directly give me a popup if I select Albedo/xBull instead of filling the form and clicking the connect wallet button.\n2. No other issues ! Great job with the dApp.",
  "When I clicked to the emission calculator, and then decided to go back, the label I had already selected and amount of carbon to sink was reset. \nSomething similar happened when trying to connect my wallet. This went wrong a few times and each time I had to select again which wallet I want to use.\nThings to improve on the sink carbon page: \n1. Mention that the icon for 1VCU is equivalent to 1000kg of carbon.\n2. Have the option to sink an amount of carbon in XLM units (aside from VCU or dollars)",
  "    - Calculated defaults to air travel and there is no way to back out if it in the interface (must use browser back button)\n    - Got prompted to add 0.032 SINK to satisfy certificate threshold, but then was told Stellarcarbon isn't currently able to retire amounts smaller than 0.100 CARBON",
  "not a real pain-point but the suggestions for airports should priotize the short-codes if given a match",
  "when i chose USDC for the asset, and it couldn't find a payment path, returning to the sink form wiped out all the input i had previously entered. that was a little frustrating.",
  "When you enter the singing page, there are quite a few clickable links at the top of the popup and I dint yet see the signature button. When you click any of the links, you are redirected via a new tab to the stellar website, and in your old page your previous popup closes, making it impossible to sign.",
  "The UI to buy the credits definitely looks like it's been done by a developer and not a UI/UX designer. I think that the visual aspect is where it's lacking the most.",
  "I was not able to login with LOBSTR or Albedo so I was unable to test anything.",
  "Trouble understanding why exactly I would contribute. So I guess I use the plane for a certain amount of carbon. So I should pay a certain amount to nature to get equal? "
