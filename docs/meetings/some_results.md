Voor wie is het gemaakt?
Stellar gebruikers & Stellar ontwikkelaars. Ze hoeven niet heel diep erin zitten, maar ze moeten wel een wallet met XLM hebben. Integratie partner kan de XLM verbergen, dus dan hoeft de eindgebruiker niks met stellar te maken te hebben.

Vision
Decentralizing Demand for Reliable Climate Compensation

At Stellarcarbon, we envision a world where CO₂ compensation is accessible to everyone—not controlled by large, polluting corporations, but available to households, communities, and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). The current system is heavily dependent on major industries in oil and automotive sectors, which hold a disproportionately large share of the demand for carbon credits. This dependency creates a market where the quality of carbon credits can be inconsistent, and where interests often extend beyond just climate and biodiversity concerns.

Stellarcarbon offers an alternative: we decentralize the demand for carbon credits, making CO₂ compensation accessible and reliable for individuals, associations, municipalities, and businesses of all sizes. By empowering more people and organizations to contribute, we build a market where small contributions collectively form a powerful counterbalance to the current centralized demand.

Solution
Integration with Stellar and Terra for Transparency and Quality

Our approach combines blockchain technology with robust validation processes. We integrate the Stellar network with Terra, offering transparent, immutable transactions that make project impacts more accessible and understandable. Terra provides essential safeguards, including independent audits and measures to prevent double-counting, ensuring the integrity and reliability of carbon credits.

At Stellarcarbon, we go further by adding our own layer of verification: we maintain direct contact with project developers, closely examine the integrity of projects, and promote transparency by facilitating transactions in stablecoins. This makes financial flows within projects more transparent and lowers transaction costs for projects, with Stellar’s partnership with MoneyGram offering faster, more accessible financial support in remote areas.

Accessible Compensation for SMEs

Small and medium-sized businesses often lack the capacity to deeply investigate CO₂ compensation options on their own. Stellarcarbon simplifies reliable, measurable compensation for these companies. We not only help them select credible projects, but also assist them in making claims that directly reflect the verified credits they have purchased and supported. This support protects them from reputational risks while enhancing their sustainability profile with transparent, credible claims.

Focus on Biodiversity and Communities
Our focus extends beyond CO₂ reduction to support projects that also protect biodiversity and benefit local communities. For us, climate compensation and biodiversity are intrinsically linked: by safeguarding natural habitats, we preserve not only carbon stores but also the unique ecosystems essential for the planet’s well-being.
