# Meeting 5 jan

Call with Hendrik, Adam, and Alex.

## Menu / sitemap

- Action button: "Try Stellarcarbon" in menu.
- Add an API / Software / Integration page. Name TBD.
- Call wallet/dashboard pages "My Account" (route: /my-account). Heading "Connection info" -> "My Account"

### Privacy Policy

Don't forget the Privacy Policy page. Replace "Carbonbank" with "Stellarcarbon". Add clause that explains that transaction info is published to the Stellar ledger, including the user's public key and the retirement reason (memo) they provide.

### Terms of Use

Terms of Use need to be written. Initial version with GPT as writing aid. Needs to specify that software and services are experimental. By using you become our tester. Give us feedback and we'll provide assistance/support.

## Going through the sink carbon user flow

How should we help new users who don't have a Stellar Wallet? Add info on the first "wallet" screen about supported Stellar wallets and on how to get started with Stellar.

Add bullet points under "accept terms" to clarify that "connect wallet" only serves to provide us with the user's public key. Warn that they should not enter their secret key, and point to SDF's security guide.

Turn "click to sink carbon" into a clear button. Style it like the other buttons.

Flip "sink carbon" and "transaction history" in the dashboard? It needs to be immediately clear to the user how to sink carbon.

One color scheme (palette) is ok for now. We can try inverting colors on the logo to see how it looks.

## Homepage

Keep explain + audit on the homepage very basic. Explain Stellar + Verra in a couple of sentences and show the contrasting "continuous audit" data. Link to /explain for more elaborate information on the Voluntary Carbon Market and how we've integrated and positioned ourselves.

Our first project: one tile on the homepage that gives some attributes of the Peru project. The whole tile can link to the project detail page.

Still decide on how to contact us? Email address in footer? Contact form? Hendrik can test by sending an email to support@stellarcarbon.io

Move SCF winner to About Us page.

Row on homepage with our call to action. Support the project through us: connect wallet & sink carbon. Help us out with your feedback (email or SCF discord). Integrate the Stellarcarbon API into your project/business.

"Stellar Entities Storing CARBON" -> Join Our "Stellar Ecosystem Partners", "Early Adopters". Simple list of partner logos.
